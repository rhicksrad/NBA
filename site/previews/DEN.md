# Denver Nuggets

Denver enters camp fresh off a 57-win and +5.4 SRS finish that sets a title-or-bust tone. guard Bruce Brown, wing Aaron Gordon, and big Jonas Valanciunas headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 6 wing/forwards, and 4 centers, with perimeter creation from Bruce Brown and Christian Braun, switchable wings such as Aaron Gordon and Cameron Johnson, and interior size via Jonas Valanciunas and Moses Brown shaping the rotation battles.
From there, honing playoff-ready counters is the chief priority. Bruce Brown's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** An elite efficiency baseline powers everythingâ€”expect crisp pace-and-space principles to carry over.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Bruce Brown's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
