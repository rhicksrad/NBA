# Atlanta Hawks

Atlanta enters camp fresh off a 36-win and -0.8 SRS finish that sets a retooling tone. guard Trae Young, big Kristaps Porzingis, and wing Jalen Johnson headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 6 wing/forwards, 3 centers, and 1 combo piece, with perimeter creation from Caleb Houstan and Charles Bassey, switchable wings such as Asa Newell and Eli John Ndiaye, interior size via Kristaps Porzingis and N'Faly Dante, and hybrid depth from Kobe Johnson shaping the rotation battles.
From there, establishing a firmer identity on both ends becomes the focal point. Caleb Houstan's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Caleb Houstan's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
