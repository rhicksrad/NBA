# Atlanta Hawks

The core trio of Bogdan Bogdanovic, Brandon Goodwin, and Bruno Fernando gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** The roster projects as league-average, but familiarity and defined roles should keep things steady.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Bogdan Bogdanovic maintaining two-way consistency is the swing skill.
