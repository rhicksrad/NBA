# Atlanta Hawks

The core trio of Asa Newell, Caleb Houstan, and Charles Bassey gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** The roster projects as league-average, but familiarity and defined roles should keep things steady.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Caleb Houstan's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
