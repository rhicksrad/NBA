# Indiana Pacers

Indiana enters camp fresh off a 47-win and +3.2 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Ben Sheppard, wing Aaron Nesmith, and big James Wiseman headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 9 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Ben Sheppard and Delon Wright, switchable wings such as Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard, and interior size via James Wiseman and Jay Huff shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Ben Sheppard's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** A balanced attack with multiple creators keeps the nightly floor high and the ceiling real.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Ben Sheppard's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
