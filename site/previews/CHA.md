# Charlotte Hornets

Charlotte enters camp fresh off a 21-win and -7.6 SRS finish that sets a development tone. guard LaMelo Ball, wing Brandon Miller, and wing Miles Bridges headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 9 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Antonio Reeves and Collin Sexton, switchable wings such as Brandon Miller and Drew Peterson, and interior size via Ibou Badji and Mason Plumlee shaping the rotation battles.
From there, building chemistry and developmental reps sits at the top of the agenda. Antonio Reeves's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Antonio Reeves's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
