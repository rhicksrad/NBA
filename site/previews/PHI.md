# Philadelphia 76ers

The core trio of Adem Bona, Andre Drummond, and Dominick Barlow gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** A top-tier efficiency profile remains the foundation; expect pace-and-space to set the tone.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Eric Gordon's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
