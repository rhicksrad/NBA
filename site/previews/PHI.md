# Philadelphia 76ers

Philadelphia enters camp fresh off a 47-win and +4.1 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Tyrese Maxey, big Joel Embiid, and wing Paul George headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 12 wing/forwards, 2 centers, and 2 combo pieces, with perimeter creation from Eric Gordon and Hunter Sallis, switchable wings such as Adem Bona and Dominick Barlow, interior size via Andre Drummond and Joel Embiid, and hybrid depth from Max Fiedler and Saint Thomas shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Eric Gordon's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** A balanced attack with multiple creators keeps the nightly floor high and the ceiling real.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Eric Gordon's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
