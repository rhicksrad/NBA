# Minnesota Timberwolves

Minnesota enters camp fresh off a 56-win and +6 SRS finish that sets a title-or-bust tone. guard Anthony Edwards, wing Julius Randle, and big Naz Reid headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 8 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Anthony Edwards and Donte DiVincenzo, switchable wings such as Alize Johnson and Enrique Freeman, and interior size via Naz Reid and Rocco Zikarsky shaping the rotation battles.
From there, honing playoff-ready counters is the chief priority. Anthony Edwards's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** An elite efficiency baseline powers everythingâ€”expect crisp pace-and-space principles to carry over.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Anthony Edwards's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
