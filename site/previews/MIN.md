# Minnesota Timberwolves

The core trio of Alize Johnson, Anthony Edwards, and Donte DiVincenzo gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** A top-tier efficiency profile remains the foundation; expect pace-and-space to set the tone.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Anthony Edwards's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
