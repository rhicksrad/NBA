Golden State enters camp fresh off a 46-win and +1.7 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Brandin Podziemski, wing Alex Toohey, and big Marques Bolden headline the returning core.
The roster lists 7 guards, 7 wing/forwards, 2 centers, and 5 combo pieces, with perimeter creation from Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield, switchable wings such as Alex Toohey and Blake Hinson, interior size via Marques Bolden and Quinten Post, and hybrid depth from Chance McMillian and Gary Payton II shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Brandin Podziemski's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
