# Golden State Warriors

Golden State enters camp fresh off a 46-win and +1.7 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Stephen Curry, wing Jimmy Butler, and wing Jonathan Kuminga headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 8 wing/forwards, 3 centers, and 5 combo pieces, with perimeter creation from Brandin Podziemski and Buddy Hield, switchable wings such as Alex Toohey and Blake Hinson, interior size via Al Horford and Marques Bolden, and hybrid depth from Chance McMillian and Gary Payton II shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Brandin Podziemski's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Brandin Podziemski's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
