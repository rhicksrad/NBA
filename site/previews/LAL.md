# Los Angeles Lakers

Los Angeles enters camp fresh off a 47-win and +1.7 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Adou Thiero, wing Anton Watson, and big Christian Koloko headline the returning core.
The roster lists 12 guards, 8 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Adou Thiero and Augustas Marƒçiulionis, switchable wings such as Anton Watson and Dalton Knecht, and interior size via Christian Koloko and Deandre Ayton shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Adou Thiero's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Adou Thiero's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
