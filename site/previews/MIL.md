# Milwaukee Bucks

Milwaukee enters camp fresh off a 49-win and +3 SRS finish that sets a upper-tier playoff tone. wing Giannis Antetokounmpo, big Myles Turner, and wing Kyle Kuzma headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 8 wing/forwards, 1 center, and 3 combo pieces, with perimeter creation from A.J. Green and Amir Coffey, switchable wings such as Bobby Portis and Chris Livingston, interior size via Myles Turner, and hybrid depth from Cormac Ryan and Gary Trent Jr. shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. A.J. Green's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** A balanced attack with multiple creators keeps the nightly floor high and the ceiling real.
**Primary risk:** Frontcourt depth is thin, so foul trouble or injuries inside could quickly snowball.
**Swing factor:** A.J. Green's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
