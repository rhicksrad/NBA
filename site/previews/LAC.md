# Los Angeles Clippers

Los Angeles enters camp fresh off a 51-win and +4.5 SRS finish that sets a upper-tier playoff tone. guard James Harden, wing Kawhi Leonard, and big John Collins headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 6 wing/forwards, 4 centers, and 1 combo piece, with perimeter creation from Bogdan Bogdanovic and Bradley Beal, switchable wings such as Derrick Jones Jr. and Kawhi Leonard, interior size via Brook Lopez and Ivica Zubac, and hybrid depth from Jahmyl Telfort shaping the rotation battles.
From there, honing playoff-ready counters is the chief priority. Bogdan Bogdanovic's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** A balanced attack with multiple creators keeps the nightly floor high and the ceiling real.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Bogdan Bogdanovic's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
