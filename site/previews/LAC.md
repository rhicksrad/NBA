**Core strength:** A top-tier efficiency profile remains the foundation; expect pace-and-space to set the tone.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Bogdan Bogdanovic's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
