# Memphis Grizzlies

Memphis enters camp fresh off a 27-win and -4.9 SRS finish that sets a development tone. guard Ja Morant, big Jaren Jackson Jr., and guard Ty Jerome headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 7 wing/forwards, 5 centers, and 1 combo piece, with perimeter creation from Braxton Key and Cam Spencer, switchable wings such as Brandon Clarke and GG Jackson, interior size via Armando Bacot and Jaren Jackson Jr., and hybrid depth from Lawson Lovering shaping the rotation battles.
From there, building chemistry and developmental reps sits at the top of the agenda. Braxton Key's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Braxton Key's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
