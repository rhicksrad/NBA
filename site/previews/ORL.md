# Orlando Magic

Orlando enters camp fresh off a 47-win and +2.4 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Alex Morales, wing Franz Wagner, and big Colin Castleton headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 8 wing/forwards, and 4 centers, with perimeter creation from Alex Morales and Anthony Black, switchable wings such as Franz Wagner and Jamal Cain, and interior size via Colin Castleton and Goga Bitadze shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Alex Morales's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Alex Morales's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
