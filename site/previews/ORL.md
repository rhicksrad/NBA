# Orlando Magic

The core trio of Chasson Randle, Chuma Okeke, and Cole Anthony gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** Solid metrics and a dependable defensive spine give this group a high nightly floor.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Chasson Randle maintaining two-way consistency is the swing skill.
