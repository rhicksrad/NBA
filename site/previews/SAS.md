# San Antonio Spurs

San Antonio enters camp fresh off a 22-win and -8 SRS finish that sets a development tone. big Victor Wembanyama, guard De'Aaron Fox, and wing Devin Vassell headline the returning core.
The roster lists 7 guards, 12 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Adam Flagler and De'Aaron Fox, switchable wings such as Carter Bryant and David Jones, and interior size via Bismack Biyombo and Luke Kornet shaping the rotation battles.
From there, building chemistry and developmental reps sits at the top of the agenda. Adam Flagler's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Adam Flagler's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
