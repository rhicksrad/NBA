# Boston Celtics

Boston enters camp fresh off a 64-win and +10.7 SRS finish that sets a title-or-bust tone. guard Anfernee Simons, wing Chris Boucher, and big Amari Williams headline the returning core.
The roster lists 10 guards, 9 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Anfernee Simons and Baylor Scheierman, switchable wings such as Chris Boucher and Hason Ward, and interior size via Amari Williams and Luka Garza shaping the rotation battles.
From there, honing playoff-ready counters is the chief priority. Anfernee Simons's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** An elite efficiency baseline powers everythingâ€”expect crisp pace-and-space principles to carry over.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Anfernee Simons's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
