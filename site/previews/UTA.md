# Utah Jazz

Utah enters camp fresh off a 31-win and -4.4 SRS finish that sets a development tone. wing Lauri Markkanen, guard Keyonte George, and big Walker Kessler headline the returning core.
The roster lists 7 guards, 8 wing/forwards, and 7 centers, with perimeter creation from Elijah Harkless and Isaiah Collier, switchable wings such as Airious Bailey and Babacar Sane, and interior size via Jusuf Nurkic and Kevin Love shaping the rotation battles.
From there, establishing a firmer identity on both ends becomes the focal point. Elijah Harkless's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Elijah Harkless's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
