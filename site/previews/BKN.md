# Brooklyn Nets

Brooklyn enters camp fresh off a 32-win and -2.7 SRS finish that sets a retooling tone. guard Cam Thomas, wing Michael Porter Jr., and wing Drew Timme headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 9 wing/forwards, 3 centers, and 1 combo piece, with perimeter creation from Ben Saraf and Cam Thomas, switchable wings such as Dariq Whitehead and Drake Powell, interior size via Danny Wolf and Day'Ron Sharpe, and hybrid depth from Haywood Highsmith shaping the rotation battles.
From there, establishing a firmer identity on both ends becomes the focal point. Ben Saraf's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Ben Saraf's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
