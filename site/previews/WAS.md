# Washington Wizards

Washington enters camp fresh off a 15-win and -8.8 SRS finish that sets a development tone. guard AJ Johnson, wing Akoldah Gak, and big Alexandre Sarr headline the returning core.
The roster lists 7 guards, 14 wing/forwards, 1 center, and 2 combo pieces, with perimeter creation from AJ Johnson and Bilal Coulibaly, switchable wings such as Akoldah Gak and Anthony Gill, interior size via Alexandre Sarr, and hybrid depth from Jonathan Pierre and Keshon Gilbert shaping the rotation battles.
From there, building chemistry and developmental reps sits at the top of the agenda. AJ Johnson's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Growth upside is the selling point, with young pieces earning larger responsibilities.
**Primary risk:** Frontcourt depth is thin, so foul trouble or injuries inside could quickly snowball.
**Swing factor:** AJ Johnson's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
