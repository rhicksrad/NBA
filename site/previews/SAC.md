# Sacramento Kings

Sacramento enters camp fresh off a 48-win and +3 SRS finish that sets a upper-tier playoff tone. guard Boogie Ellis, wing Daeqwon Plowden, and big Dylan Cardwell headline the returning core.
The roster lists 12 guards, 8 wing/forwards, and 2 centers, with perimeter creation from Boogie Ellis and DeMar DeRozan, switchable wings such as Daeqwon Plowden and Dario Saric, and interior size via Dylan Cardwell and Maxime Raynaud shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Boogie Ellis's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** A balanced attack with multiple creators keeps the nightly floor high and the ceiling real.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Boogie Ellis's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
