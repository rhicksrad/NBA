# Portland Trail Blazers

Portland enters camp fresh off a 21-win and -7.4 SRS finish that sets a development tone. guard Damian Lillard, guard Shaedon Sharpe, and wing Deni Avdija headline the returning core.
The roster lists 8 guards, 7 wing/forwards, and 6 centers, with perimeter creation from Blake Wesley and Caleb Love, switchable wings such as Deni Avdija and Jerami Grant, and interior size via Donovan Clingan and Duop Reath shaping the rotation battles.
From there, building chemistry and developmental reps sits at the top of the agenda. Blake Wesley's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Blake Wesley's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
