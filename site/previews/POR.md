# Portland Trail Blazers

The core trio of Anfernee Simons, Carmelo Anthony, and CJ Elleby gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** This is a developmental year, so cohesion and player growth drive the optimism.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Anfernee Simons maintaining two-way consistency is the swing skill.
