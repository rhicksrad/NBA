# Chicago Bulls

Chicago enters camp fresh off a 39-win and -0.4 SRS finish that sets a retooling tone. guard Coby White, big Nikola Vucevic, and guard Josh Giddey headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 9 wing/forwards, and 4 centers, with perimeter creation from Ayo Dosunmu and Coby White, switchable wings such as Dalen Terry and Emanuel Miller, and interior size via Jalen Smith and Lachlan Olbrich shaping the rotation battles.
From there, establishing a firmer identity on both ends becomes the focal point. Ayo Dosunmu's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Ayo Dosunmu's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
