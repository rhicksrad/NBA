# Detroit Pistons

The core trio of Aaron Estrada, Ausar Thompson, and Bobi Klintman gives the staff a clear identity to start from.
The front office kept the core intact and will lean on internal development.
No rotation regulars departed, so continuity remains a strength.

**Core strength:** This is a developmental year, so cohesion and player growth drive the optimism.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error is slim if the shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Aaron Estrada's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
