# New Orleans Pelicans

New Orleans enters camp fresh off a 49-win and +4.6 SRS finish that sets a upper-tier playoff tone. wing Zion Williamson, wing Trey Murphy III, and guard Jordan Poole headline the returning core.
The roster lists 8 guards, 7 wing/forwards, 5 centers, and 1 combo piece, with perimeter creation from Bryce McGowens and Dejounte Murray, switchable wings such as Herbert Jones and Jalen McDaniels, interior size via Derik Queen and Garrison Brooks, and hybrid depth from Christian Shumate shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Bryce McGowens's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** A balanced attack with multiple creators keeps the nightly floor high and the ceiling real.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Bryce McGowens's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
