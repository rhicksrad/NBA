# Houston Rockets

Houston enters camp fresh off a 41-win and +1.4 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Aaron Holiday, wing Amen Thompson, and big Alperen Sengun headline the returning core.
The roster lists 6 guards, 9 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from Aaron Holiday and Fred VanVleet, switchable wings such as Amen Thompson and Cameron Matthews, and interior size via Alperen Sengun and Clint Capela shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Aaron Holiday's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Aaron Holiday's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
