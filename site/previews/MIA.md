# Miami Heat

Miami enters camp fresh off a 46-win and +1.5 SRS finish that sets a playoff chase tone. guard Caleb Daniels, wing Andrew Wiggins, and big Bam Adebayo headline the returning core.
The roster lists 11 guards, 7 wing/forwards, 3 centers, and 2 combo pieces, with perimeter creation from Caleb Daniels and Davion Mitchell, switchable wings such as Andrew Wiggins and Keshad Johnson, interior size via Bam Adebayo and Kel'el Ware, and hybrid depth from Dain Dainja and Warren Washington shaping the rotation battles.
From there, the staff will refine lineup versatility to climb the standings. Caleb Daniels's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** Caleb Daniels's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
