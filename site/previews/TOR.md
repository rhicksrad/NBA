# Toronto Raptors

Toronto enters camp fresh off a 25-win and -5.6 SRS finish that sets a development tone. guard AJ Lawson, wing Brandon Ingram, and big Jakob Poeltl headline the returning core.
The roster lists 9 guards, 9 wing/forwards, and 3 centers, with perimeter creation from AJ Lawson and Alijah Martin, switchable wings such as Brandon Ingram and Collin Murray-Boyles, and interior size via Jakob Poeltl and Olivier Sarr shaping the rotation battles.
From there, building chemistry and developmental reps sits at the top of the agenda. AJ Lawson's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.

**Core strength:** Depth across the positional spectrum lets the staff mix-and-match without sacrificing identity.
**Primary risk:** The margin for error tightens if perimeter shooting variance swings the wrong way.
**Swing factor:** AJ Lawson's lead guard reps will determine how dynamic the offense looks.
