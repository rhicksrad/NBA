# Contributing to NBA Pulse

Thanks for helping improve NBA Pulse! Follow the steps below to keep the project healthy and production-ready.

## Pull request checklist

- Create feature branches off the latest `main` branch.
- Run `pnpm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date.
- Execute the quality gates locally:
  ```bash
  pnpm run build
  pnpm run validate:data
  pnpm run check:links
  pnpm run check:lighthouse
  ```
- Confirm Lighthouse scores meet or exceed the enforced budgets.
- `pnpm run check:links` uses linkinator to fail the build on 4xx/5xx responses.
- Update documentation or data provenance notes when modules change.
- Add a changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing updates.

## Code style

- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible aria attributes.
- Keep JavaScript framework-free; use TypeScript within `components/`.
- Hash browser bundles via `scripts/build-assets.mjs`.
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA (â‰¥ 4.5:1).

## Reporting issues

Open a GitHub issue with:
- A clear summary and reproduction steps.
- Browser/OS details.
- Screenshots or Lighthouse reports when relevant.

## Security

Do not include secrets or API keys in issues or pull requests. Email maintainers privately for any security concerns.
